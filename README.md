## Description

`byte-wise` is a website designed for visualizing different algorithms and data structures step-by-step. This interactive platform allows users to see how algorithms work in real-time, providing a clearer understanding of their processes.

## Importance / Motivation

Understanding complex algorithms can be challenging. Simply reading the code can show how an algorithm functions but might not explain why it works or how it handles various cases. Conversely, textual descriptions often provide theoretical insights but lack practical visualization. `byte-wise` bridges this gap by offering side-by-side visualizations and code explanations, enabling users to gain an intuitive grasp of algorithms and data structures.
## Features

- **Step-by-Step Visualizations**: Interactive graphics that illustrate how algorithms and data structures operate.
- **Code Integration**: Side-by-side code snippets to show the implementation alongside the visual representation.


## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
